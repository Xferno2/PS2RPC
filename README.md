# PS2RPC
If you are using OPL on your Playstation2, connected with SMB to your computer, you can now display what you are playing on discord with this implementation of rich presence.

### Please
Use [OPL Manager](https://oplmanager.com/site/) to correctly format the name of the games, so that the program can display games name correctly on Discord.

## Disclaimer
This is program is not even close to be finish. The detection of games is lacking especially when you restart your PS2 very fast and load an other game. This is still in active development right now.
